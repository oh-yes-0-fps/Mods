/Script/OakGame.GFxPauseMenu.OnQuitChoiceMade //on game quit
/Script/GbxGameSystemCore.DamageComponent.ReceiveAnyDamage //Triggers for all actors upon taking damage(works with extra elements tho)
/Script/GbxGameSystemCore.DamageData.OnHitAnyAttitude //Triggers on hit for player and other actors, doesnt work with multiple elements(probably bes hook for onhit abilities)
/Script/GbxGameSystemCore.DamageData.OnKilledEnemy //same as above but for killing something instead(again probably best for kill skills and such)
/Script/OakGame.OakCharacter.AddedToInventory //Triggers on item pickup
